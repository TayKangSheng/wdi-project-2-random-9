# photozine, web app for photographers

This is a project for GA WDI-SG 8 Project 2. It is a web application that not only allows photographers to publish and share their work online, but also enables users of the app to create their very own curation of photographs, by adding photos to their zines (short for magazine or fanzine).

## Future improvements
